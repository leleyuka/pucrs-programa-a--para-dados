1102500,A Glider's Journey,"Sep 27, 2019",20000 - 50000,0,0,4.99,0,"A Glider's journey is a game about exploring a relaxing, colorful low poly world; while still challenging your piloting skills till the very end of each level. The very simple controls (one joystick, no throttle no rudder) makes it very easy to pickup, but hard to master, thanks to the physics-based flight model. 'HARD-CORE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE' It offers a realistic flying experience, quite similar to an actual flying wing, where stalls and spins are a definite possibility... A 'Very Easy' mode with simplified physics is also available, if you are rather seeking a more relaxing low-poly world exploration experience. 15 levels featuring a variety of unique low poly biomes. (playtime ranging from 40 minutes to 2+ hours depending on your skill set) Unique custom made soundtrack for every level style and feel. Fully Physics simulated flight model. An immersive experience thanks to the removal of all HUDs, completely replaced by subtle visual and audio indicators, such as the wind noise and wing particles for speed, the color of the wings for the progression of the level etc... A variety of flight maneuvers, from chandelles to split S'es and spirals. Intuitive ​flight controls 'Very easy' mode with approximated, simplified physics Quick note: A Glider's journey was entirely made by a pair of passion driven indie game developers, so please keep that in mind when you think about buying this game. It's a small and simple game with not that many hours of gameplay. What we wanted to create is a simple but challenging game that could give you the feeling of flying in a different reality.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/header.jpg?t=1569583065,,,emma@emmafranklin.ch,True,False,False,0,,0,42,27,,10,0,,0,0,0,0,"Emma Franklin,Charlie Marshall",Emma Franklin,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,Simulation","Casual,Action,Indie,Adventure,Simulation,Flight,Physics,Difficult,Atmospheric,Singleplayer,Racing,Relaxing,Great Soundtrack,Arcade,Exploration","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_a73078f8173fc83ce74b12f2bd3ae70239d8d45d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_8265a30a4675f51dc42bf0dae2ee346171a2ca32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_ed0adb9d09099b7bd37339456b90423d5748219c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_7149474985fe5fd1d6f0d792f3632532aad42ea9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_97d99e7ca944f727a347d63669d9cf4d6f3f34d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_d85675e9a0824612137e5109ad8606e189819f09.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_351ffaa2d6a75293b66a92a7b6c137953be24e3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_a472744da82c1b3ab8de219731906d1aaf726b56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_bac2d4f3f91156e4392ee0f0eb9e77fe6c1b4409.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_4966b1d7d4048af00ea8adf1e70cbc1529fb4f1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_b3507290c7c514b48ba5dbeba24149bc8a8e9ba9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_4550979f7381223e04094ede5c9167f32569d7b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_ea3cfc190aa8f06af215905542f5c9da605dfa6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_6ec0d049b960ae29e4c2483a7b76bfbfb8da8e67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_d3908639befe81b44d2a9f3ff6e3a11f1a520eff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_88ad5d494a07b6ab9b1e2f68683e5caa9da0e6d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1102500/ss_05927b64ec3d33ad030516503c239d921cdf1106.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569583065",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256754854/movie_max.mp4?t=1561856095

2138290,FRAIM - Survival Rhythm Aim Trainer,"Nov 1, 2022",0 - 0,0,0,0.0,0,"What's FRAIM? FRAIM is a super fun and addicting survival rhythm aim trainer focused mostly on micro-adjustment shots, which are the most important type of shots in a highly competitive first person shooters. Why is it designed that way? The game is played in between two frames. Targets spawn in the back frame and disappear once they get inside the front frame, which creates a sense of hurry. This fact is very important for aim training, as although you try your best to aim as fast as possible in other trainers, you generally won't force yourself to take shots which you don't feel confident in and are crucial for your development. In FRAIM you are forced to challenge yourself for your survival by design . Challenge by design Each track comes in five different difficulties to make sure that you can properly challenge yourself. But what if I'm stuck in between difficulties? You can easily override levels in the game. For instance, if you find that it gets easier to pass 'Hard' levels, but too hard to pass 'Expert' levels, you can choose to play the game as hard but override the targets to be smaller, play it as expert and increase the target size, increase/decrease the frame's surface, and much more. Playing in override mode would not affect your scores, they are simply training wheels to help you get to the next difficulty. Make it feel like your preferred game In the settings menu you can change your game profile. By doing so, you make sure that the FOV and the sensitivity feels exactly like they do in the selected game.
